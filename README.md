# Html Assistant

## About

Have you ever tried to write a simple website without php or rails help and got annoyed with copying and pasting header and navigation bar to all pages?

Html Assistant is a GUI program that saves your time with copying the same navigation/footer/header across all .html pages in specified folder.

1. Click on open folder button
2. Specify class of the navigation in replace text box
	``` <div class="navigation"> ```
3. Write new navigation in the text field below
4. Press Update Navigation button
5. That's it. No more copy & pasting :)
